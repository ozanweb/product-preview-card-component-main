## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-- The fonts imported (using ```@import```) from online sources always must be at the top of CSS file.

### Continued development

-- The transition between mobile and desktop version of the image could be done using JS. This would be more efficent.
